# Firebase Setup

## Step 1 — Create Firebase Project

Open:

[https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)

Create a new Firebase project.

---

## Step 2 — Install Firebase CLI

Run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

---

## Step 3 — Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

Recommended options:

* Gemini in Firebase → No
* Analytics/Error Reporting → Yes or No (optional)

---

## Step 4 — Install FlutterFire CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

---

## Step 5 — Configure Firebase

Inside project terminal:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

Select:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS (optional)

This generates:

```text
firebase_options.dart
```

IMPORTANT:
Do not delete this file.

---

# Required Packages

Install packages using terminal.

## Firebase Core

```bash
flutter pub add firebase_core
```

## Firebase Auth

```bash
flutter pub add firebase_auth
```

## Cloud Firestore

```bash
flutter pub add cloud_firestore
```

## HTTP Package

```bash
flutter pub add http
```

## Intl Package

```bash
flutter pub add intl
```

---

# Firestore Rules

Open:

Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules

Use this during development:

```js
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Click:

Publish

IMPORTANT:
This is only for development/testing.

---

# Running the App

## Clean Project

```bash
flutter clean
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Run App

```bash
flutter run
```

---

# Authentication Flow

## Signup

Uses:

```dart
FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword()
```

## Login

Uses:

```dart
FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword()
```

## Persistent Login

Inside `main.dart`:

```dart
home: FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser != null
    ? const HomePage()
    : const LoginPage(),
```

This keeps users logged in after rebuild/restart.

---

# Firestore Flow

## Add Task

Task object is converted into Map:

```dart
task.toMap()
```

Saved using:

```dart
tasks.add(task.toMap())
```

---

## Update Task

Uses document ID:

```dart
tasks.doc(id).update(task.toMap())
```

---

## Delete Task

```dart
tasks.doc(id).delete()
```

---

# Task Date Logic

Task date is automatically generated during task creation.

Example:

```dart
String currentDate =
    DateFormat('dd MMM yyyy - hh:mm a')
        .format(DateTime.now());
```

IMPORTANT:
Date is generated only once during task creation.

It is then stored permanently in Firestore.

---

# Quote API

API Used:

```text
https://zenquotes.io/api/random
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "q": "Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.",
    "a": "Babe Ruth"
  }
]
```

Quote Service fetches:

```dart
data['q']
data['a']
```

---

# Modal Bottom Sheet Flow

Instead of opening a new screen directly:

```dart
Navigator.push()
```

The app uses:

```dart
showModalBottomSheet()
```

The entire `AddTaskScreen` UI is rendered inside the modal.

Benefits:

* Cleaner UI
* Modern UX
* Less navigation complexity
* Faster interactions

```

Fix:

Use:

```text
https://zenquotes.io/api/random

## Navigator.pop Not Working

Ensure:

* screen opened using `Navigator.push()`
* async flow completes properly
* correct BuildContext used
